# Vigenere-Cipher-Java
Java implementation of the classical Vigenère cipher. Includes input validation, encryption logic, and user interface for encoding messages.

## Description
This project implements the classical Vigenère cipher algorithm in Java. It allows users to encrypt messages using a keyword-based substitution method.

## Features
- Input validation for plaintext and key
- Character-by-character encryption logic
- Simple command-line interface

## How to Run
Compile and run the `Main.java` file. Enter your message and keyword to see the encrypted output.
